                <p>
                Welcome to the official Animal Crossing page. We help you find a home in the wonderful town of Animal Crossing. 
                Create your own paradise as you explore the area and meet new friends. Animal Crossing has a wealth of natural resources that can be used 
                to craft everything from tools to creature comforts. You can hunt down insects at the crack of dawn, 
                decorate your paradise throughout the day, or enjoy sunset on the beach while fishing in the ocean. 
                Even without hopping on a flight, you’ll meet a cast of charming animal residents bursting with personality. 
                Friendly faces like Tom Nook and Isabelle will lend their services and happily help you grow your budding 
                community. Escape to your island getaway—however, whenever, and wherever you want.
