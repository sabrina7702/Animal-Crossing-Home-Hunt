                        <p>Animal Crossing would not be popular for its nature if there was no dedicated camping club. Anyone can sign up, but people under 18 must have a gaurdian
                            with them. The camp team takes a 3 day trip out to the wilderness and learns how to camp like a pro with their assigned instructor. You can sign up in a team, or 
                            with your own party.

                        <p>If you didn't feel like camping or missed the chance to do it, every Friday night a movie will air in the middle of town. It's family friendly 
                            and there's food stands that sell snacks you can't get anywhere else. Drive in and enjoy the movie in your car, or book a spot and bring your own 
                            chairs, blankets, etc.
